 Well you need to sort it then as the page is still live and I've told friends family and colleagues where they can buy it for 36 so expect a few people visiting the store to buy it for 36, We'd always recommend visiting Tesco Direct for our latest prices  Best wishes  Mike
 And I wouldn't have found it in the tesco express store by searching on the main tesco site as you are 2 separate entities. So why advertise it in an express store if it's not available for the price you've advertised?, As my colleague advised this may have been an old cached page  - Ceri
 So tesco direct had it advertised for 48 an in Tesco express they were in stock and advertised as 36. As you said they are 2 separate entities so why was I told that the price in store was 48 the same price as the separate entity and not 36 as advertised," I'm sorry about this but if you had searched on google etc for the COD game sold by Tesco this may have been an old cached page  If you had visited our website, this would have shown the correct price  Ty- Karen"

" Paddington to Pewsey, Sunday 10th preferably in the morning"," There are trains running but you will need to travel via Westbury if leaving Paddington at 07:51  If leaving at 10:03, changing at Swindon and then Westbury  Lewis"
 OK but why does the journey planner not tell me this?, Lewis
 According to the National Rail journey planner there are no trains ( or even a replacement bus service) for most of the day on Sunday the 10th Dec. What is going on?, What journey are you looking to make please? Natalie
"  another cold and draughty journey on a train built in the 1970‚Äôs. First class ticket, third class service", Sorry for this  If you raise with on-board staff they maybe able to reset the heating if not working  Lewis
Fantastic service from Mark on the  ticket desk at Bristol Temple Meads getting us back to London. Many thanks., Natalie
" Sitting on train in Oxford, waiting indefinitely to hear if it is cancelled or not. No alternative for me if it is. Pathetic service as usual", Sorry for the delay  This is due to a safety inspection of the track taking place  Lewis
 hi will the 1649h Bristol TM to Weymouth be 3-coach train tonight?  Thanks., It will be 3 today  Lewis
 No. Wasn't aware until 10mins before I got off. Return 1530 Bristol TM Paddington has no buffet/drinking water. Glad I got a tea before boarding., I'll make sure these get reported and looked into  Lewis
 Props to your man Brad at Cheltenham ticket office today. Super helpful with my ticket problem. I offered him a Celebration in thanks but he politely declined :), Pleased to see my colleague impressed  I'll make sure his Manager is made aware of your message  Lewis

 I'm forever complaining about the service. The 15.47 from Cardiff to Swansea is late yet again!!, It was delayed due to following a late running preceding service earlier in the journey  It is currently running 22 minutes behind schedule  Lewis
" It's only now leaving Cardiff, 16.11. Was appalling yesterday too. It's pretty cold hanging around", I appreciate it's not the day when you want to be waiting around  Lewis
How fitting!  Squadron Leader Harold Starr took us and Isambard Kingdom Brunel brings us home! Thanks  URL_POSITION, Looks like you had a fun  Glad you enjoyed your journeys  Lewis

 Why is the 2O94 1450 Great Malvern-Weymouth service always late by the time it gets to Filton Abbey Wood? Late every day for a week &amp; surprise surprise late again tonight....., Apologies for any recent delays  Services can be late for different reasons  I can see today the 3 minute delay was caused due to a freight train running in front of your service - Josh
 You're missing the point. Do you regularly reserve all the seats on a train? Does that seem fair?, Lewis
" No, because I changed to this train at the last minute. You cancelled the 1615 I was aiming for.", If you reserved a seat on the 16:15 service you can claim compensation for standing on 16:30  This can be done by emailing __email__  Lewis
 I'm sat on the floor in the end of the train by the door. Can I confirm you haven't reserved this space for someone too?, Sorry you haven't got a seat  Did you make a seat reservation? Lewis
" what is your plan to allow the new trains to open their rear doors at Didcot, and how long do you expect to take to resolve it?", Lewis
" what is your plan to allow the new trains to open their rear doors at Didcot, and how long do you expect to take to resolve it?"," 2/3  The driver can override the system and select the option to open all the doors, however this doesn‚Äôt seem to happen every time I'm afraid."
 a) why is the 1624 from reading to Oxford delayed and b) why is it not stopping at pangbourne," Apologies for this  I can see the train is currently 3 minutes, no reason has been attributed yet  The train is no longer calling at Pangbourne due to a broken down train - Josh"
" what is your plan to allow the new trains to open their rear doors at Didcot, and how long do you expect to take to resolve it?"," Sorry it has taken so long to get back to you  For stations where platforms differ in length such as Didcot, the train will automatically as a safety feature default to the door opening for the shortest platform  1/3"
" Bristol train was also overcrowded, resulting in my standing/sitting in the doorway for the entire journey. How do I claim for a refund?", Sorry for the difficult journey  If you were delayed by an hour or reserved a seat but had to stand you can claim compensation  This can be done by emailing __email__  Lewis

" that doesn't help my discomfort. Travelling to spend time with my dying Dad, freezing and paying ¬£96 for the privellage is unacceptable", Lewis
I think it's about time train companies take a more human approach when dealing with passengers regarding losing part of their train ticket   , The safe keeping of a ticket is detailed in the National Conditions of Travel  If there are extenuating circumstances there are occasions when we would look beyond this though  Lewis
  REAL reason is GWR are repairing carriages and selling onto Scotrail rather than bringing back into use :- (link: URL_POSITION) URL_POSITION  lack of passenger care by GWR and the fact they are lying about the repairs, That isn't accurate  We do not own trains to sell  The HST's came to the end of their lease as scheduled  They have been replaced by our IET services - Josh
"  ahhhhh.  so through your poor mis management there is a shortfall of leased carriages before the new ones are available on every route, yet you still put the fares up above inflation every year and GWR profits were c¬£100m last year as well as taxpayer subsidies. #nowlostforwords", We just have more trains than usual in for repair on certain routes  Our maintenance teams are working hard to get all trains in service- J
  incorrect. maidenhead to Reading is not electrified. you run most services on 2-3 carriages at best.  lease more carriages!?,"  As explained, we have a full quota of stock but some are needing repair - Josh"
  then expand the quota. i have tweeted every single day for 12 months for you to sort this.  your quota isnt enough based upon the hundreds of customers complaints you are receiving," Leases are agreed upon as part of the franchise agreement and until recently when new trains have started entering service, there simply weren't extra ones available  Lewis"
"  don‚Äôt buy it. you makes 100‚Äôs of millions in profits every year, bleed passengers dry and cause severe discomfort and risk of accident down to a drive for profits and poor project management bordering on corporate negligence", The information we have provided is accurate  - Josh
   The point is you haven‚Äôt leased enough trains to support he service you have promised customers. This is your planning problem not the problem of those leasing the trains to you.  Basic business lesson needed., Thank you for your enquiry  One of the team will respond to you first thing in the morning  AndyD
  REAL reason is GWR are repairing carriages and selling onto Scotrail rather than bringing back into use :- (link: URL_POSITION) URL_POSITION  lack of passenger care by GWR and the fact they are lying about the repairs, We don't own carriages so none have been sold  Trains are hired under leases agreed as part of the franchise agreement  Lewis
  hi. point taken. but we are paying for a service.  sometimes ¬£4-6k a year per passenger with no guarantee of a seat. you know the demand on each service. you should be hiring more carriages then. no?, I appreciate when a service is busy it can be uncomfortable  This is why we are introducing our IET's with added capacity - Josh
"  I‚Äôll accept that, but one has to concede that rush hour is a reasonably predictable phenomenon....", We provide all trains that are available to use during these periods  We recommend customers reserve a seat to guarantee one - Josh
 Two carriage train to Taunton from Bristol. Surely you‚Äôre having a laugh at rush hour? Rammed in like sardines. Staggering fail., Apologies for the busy service  The train has been shortformed due to more trains than usual being in for repair at once - Josh
 Not uncommon though is it. It‚Äôs not really our problem either. More rolling stock would help considering fare prices., As more new trains enter service others will be moved around  There will be extra capacity on that route next year  Lewis
"Customer Services Manager on the 1630 Pad-Taunton just announced that the trolley can't get through due to 'over-crowding'. So,  - when one of your staff says the train is too busy, is it??","  Although trains are designed to safely accommodate standing passengers, I do appreciate this can make it difficult for facilities like the trolley  Apologies it can't get through  Lewis"
"Hi  how long should I wait to hear about a compensation request? Put it in on 31 October, heard nothing beyond the initial acknowledgement email."," There is a delay at present, apologies for this  If you don't hear anything in the next two weeks please get in touch with us so we can chase - Josh"
"Another train journey, another cancelled train, another packed standing train. A big thank you ", Apologies for the cancellation and the problems this has caused for the later train  What journey are you making? Lewis
 Hi! Can I use my oyster to check in at Paddington for a journey to Maidenhead? Or do I need to buy a ticket? Thanks!, You will need to purchase a ticket for that journey - Josh
"Absolutely disgraceful ‚Äòservice‚Äô AGAIN from  can‚Äôt even be bothered to roster their staff properly, to cover their timetable. They‚Äôre more than happy however, to take my fares to pay for a ‚Äòservice‚Äô they won‚Äôt provide. URL_POSITION", Sorry for the cancellation  What journey are you making? Lewis
" You need to stop saying sorry and start delivering a proper service. Where are your staff? I suppose ‚Äòstaff shortages‚Äô in your world is euphemistic for can‚Äôt be arsed to turn up for work. As it stands, I‚Äôm going to have to change at Redhill and get home an hour late."," Reason for staff shortages can vary, it is not always down to sickness  Lewis"
" So why was my train cancelled? I‚Äôd like the specific reason for the staff shortage, not a bland response", Apologies again for the disruption this evening  Lewis
 why? Train fault? URL_POSITION, This was cancelled due to train unavailability due to more trains than usual being in for repairs  - Josh
 very much not enjoying the 16.45 to Cardiff -previous train cancelled. Could you not have added extra carriages?  Are people going to be standing all the way from London to Wales?, Really sorry for the busy service and any discomfort caused  All available carriages are in use at present - Josh
 your tickets sales staff are the least helpful people I‚Äôve met... any chance you can send them a bit of Christmas cheer? ü§∑üèª‚Äç‚ôÇÔ∏è#justsaying, Sorry to hear this  Do you need ticket advice now? Lewis

Red in particular, which should not be chilled.", Sorry for any inconvenience caused  I wouldn't be able to comment as we aren't aware of the reason for the closure - Josh
  the serious overcrowding on the 1720 from BTM to Cardiff is unaccepable. - standing up squeezed against everyone is not what you want when you‚Äôre off a flight with luggage to boot üò°, Sorry for the difficult conditions  During peak periods all available carriages are in use  Did you reserve a seat? Lewis
" Because, of course, saving a bit of money is more important than passengers.", Apologies for any issues caused by the cancellation tonight Ben - Josh

 Your ticket clerk at Yeovil Pen Mill told me today that my ticket wasn‚Äôt valid on the 1653 Pen Mill to Waterloo (via Westbury) train because it has a Network Railcard discount. Is this correct? URL_POSITION, That's correct  Your journey exceeds the railcards limitations - Josh
 I thought tickets with a Network Railcard discount are valid (only) on through services between Yeovil Pen Mill and London Waterloo (via Westbury). Have I got this wrong?, The journey has to be wholly within the network railcard area  Lewis
" Hi Lewis, I read this in  Magazine, contradicting what your ticket clerk and you are telling me. It says on through services (which the 1653 Pen Mill to Waterloo is) then my ticket is valid. It‚Äôs very frustrating getting conflicting answers. Who‚Äôs correct?  URL_POSITION", As it a South Western Railway journey I'd advise speaking with them directly  Lewis
